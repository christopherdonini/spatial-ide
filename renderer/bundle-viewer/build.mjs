// and no module resolution beyond relative paths.

// **Deterministic on purpose.** The manifest lists a content hash for every viewer asset, so two
// builds of the same sources must produce the same bytes or a bundle's hashes would depend on when
// it was built. `sourcemap: false` because a sourcemap embeds absolute paths — which would both
// break determinism and put a filesystem path in a published artifact (docs/09).

 * The notice set every published bundle must carry (ADR-009 item 7; ADR-017 Corrigendum 3).
 *
 * ## Derived from the metafile, never from a hand-kept list
 *
 * `bundle: true` compiles third-party code into `dist/app.js` — today `apache-arrow` and
 * `flatbuffers` (Apache-2.0, and Arrow ships a NOTICE whose contents §4(d) requires to travel) and
 * `tslib` (0BSD). A hardcoded list would be correct until the first dependency change and wrong
 * silently afterwards, which for a legal notice is the worst failure shape available. esbuild's
 * metafile records every input it actually read, so this is a function of the build rather than a
 * claim about it.
 *
 * ## Deterministic, because the manifest hashes it
 *
 * The publish operation lists a content hash for every viewer asset and ADR-017 §12 promises
 * byte-identical rebuilds, so this file must not depend on directory order or on the clock.
 * Packages are sorted by name and each package's files by filename. **No timestamp is written.**
